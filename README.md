# 🧵 Handmade Marketplace App - iOS

Welcome to the official documentation for the Handmade Marketplace App – an iOS e-commerce solution built with love for small artisans and handmade vendors. This app was designed to provide a seamless shopping and selling experience, integrating secure payments, modern architecture, and elegant user experience.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Handmade Marketplace is a fully functional mobile app that allows users to:

* Explore handmade products from multiple vendors.
* Sign up and log in using social platforms (Facebook, Google, Apple).
* Purchase products securely using Stripe.
* Leave reviews and ratings on purchased products.
* Browse user-friendly interfaces built with UIKit.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture - MVVM + Design Patterns + SOLID Principles

We implemented the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** design pattern to ensure:

* Clean separation of concerns.
* Easier testability and maintainability.
* Reactive UI updates via Combine.

Additional design patterns used:

* **Factory** – For object creation (products, users, reviews).
* **Coordinator** – For handling navigation flow.
* **Singleton** – For shared managers.
---

## 📦 Packages & Frameworks Used

We leveraged powerful Swift libraries and Apple frameworks to deliver a production-ready experience:

- **Alamofire** – Networking layer for REST APIs.
- **Firebase** – Authentication, Firestore, and hosting backend services.
- **Stripe iOS SDK** – Secure payments with Apple Pay support.
- **Cosmos** – Star rating control for reviews.
- **Kingfisher** – Downloading & caching images.
- **Lottie** – Animated vector illustrations for engaging UI.
- **Loading Buttons** – Custom styled loading buttons.
- **SkeletonView** – Placeholder skeletons for loading states.
- **ViewAnimator** – One-line view animations for smooth UX.
- **SwiftyJSON** – Easy JSON parsing.
- **SDWebImage** – Image caching & loading.
- **Realm** – Local database for offline-first experience.
- **SwiftGen** – Code generation for assets & strings.
- **SwiftLint** – Linting to enforce Swift style guidelines.
- **Combine** – Reactive programming for UI binding.
- **Async/Await** – Modern concurrency and background task handling.
- **Core ML** – For intelligent recommendations and classifiers (future features).

## 💳 Payment Integration with Stripe

Stripe’s **EmbeddedPaymentElement** API is used for a secure and customizable checkout:

* Supports multiple vendors.
* Apple Pay ready.
* Secure client secret flow via backend.

### Highlights:

* Seamless checkout experience.

---

## 🎨 UI Design with UIKit

Using UIKit allowed us to build:

* Responsive layouts with Auto Layout.
* Reusable custom components like `CardViewCell`.
* A smooth, animated checkout flow.
* Localization support for multiple languages.

---

## 🔐 Authentication with Firebase

We use **Firebase Authentication** to simplify sign-in:

* Google Sign-In
* Facebook Login
* Apple Sign-In

Firebase handles token validation, user identity, and security. The sign-in status syncs with Firestore user data.

---

## 🌐 Networking with Alamofire

We used **Alamofire** to manage all HTTP networking:

* Easy to send authenticated requests.
* Upload and download product images.
* Fetch product listings, vendor data, reviews.

---

## 🛍️ Product Browsing & Reviews

Users can:

* Browse curated product categories.
* See detailed product views with images, prices, and highlights.
* Add reviews with star ratings and comments.
* View other customers’ feedback.

All reviews are stored in Firestore and linked by `productId`.

---

## 📚 Conclusion

This project blends solid architecture (MVVM), modern UI with UIKit, and powerful integrations like Stripe and Firebase to deliver a feature-rich, scalable handmade marketplace app.

✨ We believe small makers deserve big tech. ✨
